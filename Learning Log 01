From now on I will be updating a daily record of my plans and actions relating to my continual learning. 


11 Nov.  Reviewed the Pipenv virtual environment tutorial video.

12 Nov.  Did a quick python exercise for temperature conversion... 
    here is the result... 
# Step 1: Prompt the user to enter a temperature in Celsius
celsius = float(input("Enter temperature in Celsius: "))

# Step 2: Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
fahrenheit = celsius * (9/5) + 32

# Step 3: Print the converted temperature
print(f"Temperature in Fahrenheit: {fahrenheit}")


14 Nov. Job search in LinkedIn, marked a couple of jobs to follow up.
